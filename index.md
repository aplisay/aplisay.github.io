# Product Test Interviews

Aplisay is conducting remote interviews to get feedback on an experimental new product we are developing. The product aims to improve the ability of small businesses and charities to respond to the contact needs of their clients. We don't want to give away more details than that as the process relies on testers seeing the concept for the first time during the session.

<img align="right" width="320" src="assets/usertesting.jpeg"> The testing sessions will take place remotely during the day on **Friday 10th July**. The process will involve showing you the product, watching you attempt to use it via a screenshare, and taking your feedback on how you felt it worked. The whole process should be informal, fun and will take less than an hour from start to finish.

As a thank you, we will give you a **£30 Amazon Gift Card** *OR* **donate £50** to **any UK registered charity you nominate** at the end of the interview.

If you like the product that you have helped us shape, then we will also be pleased to give you free access to a beta release of the product for at least two months before it releases, but this is **NOT** a sales pitch.

## Privacy and data use

We will delete the contact data supplied by everyone that applies to take part in these interviews at the end of the testing process. We will not disclose your details to any other party not involved in the testing interviews nor contact you other than for matters related to the test interviews.
