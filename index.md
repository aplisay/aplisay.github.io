# Product Test Interviews

We want to conduct remote interviews with people who will give us feedback on an experimental new product we are developing. The product is one that that we hope will improve the ability of small businesses and charities to respond to the contact needs of their clients but we don't want to give away too many details ahead of the tests as the process relies on you seeing it for the first time then.

We will conduct the interviews remotely during the day on Friday 10th July. The process will involve showing you the product, watching you attempt to use it via a screenshare, and taking your feedback on how you felt it worked. The whole process will be informal, fun and will take less than an hour from start to finish.

As a thank you, we will give you a **£30 Amazon Gift Card** *OR* **donate £50** to **any UK registered charity you nominate**.

If you like the product that you have helped us shape, then we will also be pleased to give you free access to a beta release of the product for at least two months before it releases, but this is **NOT** a sales pitch.

**Privacy:** we will delete the data of everyone that applies to take part in these interviews at the end of the testing process and will not disclose your data to any other party nor contact you as a result of giving us your details on the test application form other than to tell ask to book a testing session with you.
