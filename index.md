# Product Test Interviews

We want to conduct remote interviews with people who will give us feedback on an experimental new product we are developing. We don't want to give any details about the product you will be testing ahead of the tests as the test process relies on you seeing it for the first time then, but it is a product that that we hope will improve the ability of businesses and charities to respond to the needs of their clients.

We will conduct these interviews remotely during the day on Friday 10th July where the process will involve showing you the product, watching you attempt to use it via a screenshare, and taking your feedback on how you felt it worked. The whole process will be informal, fun and will take less than an hour from start to finish.

As a thank you, we will give you a **£30 Amazon Gift Card** *OR* **donate £50** to **any UK registered charity you nominate**.

If you like the product that you have helped us shape, then we will also be pleased to give you free access to a beta release of the product for at least two months before it releases, but this is **NOT** a sales pitch.

**Privacy:** we will delete the data of everyone that applies to take part in these interviews at the end of the testing process and will not disclose your data to any other party nor contact you as a result of giving us your details on the test application form other than to tell ask to book a testing session with you.
